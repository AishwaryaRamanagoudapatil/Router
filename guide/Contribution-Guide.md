# Contribution Guide
Glad you chose to contribute to this Project. I'll  show you around to explain how you can do so without being stuck at crossroads.

Basically you can follow up in 2 ways
- Github only (Easy & Quick)
- Git and Github (Technical & Hacky)

### Using only Github
```bash
- Visit the URL - https://github.com/zrqx/Router
- Click on Fork Button on the Top Right
- Enter the Details and click on 'Create Fork'. That will create a fork (copy) of that repository.

- Click on the Edit Button on the Right (Pencil Icon)
- Add your changes into the file
- Scroll down and in `Commit changes` tab, add relevant commit message and click on `Commit Changes`
Now you can see the changes, but the changes are applied only for your forked (copied) repository

Next step is to Push those changes to the original repository (Pull Request).
- Click on `Pull Requests` on the Top Left
- Click on `New Pull Request`
- Click on `Create Pull Request`
- In the Pull Request form, add details explaing what you contributed
- Click on `Create Pull Request`

That is all! You have successfully contributed to a Project. It is the responsibility of the maintainer to Review and Accept/Deny your Request. 
```

### Git and Github
```bash
Fork the Repo in the way mentioned above
git clone repo
Make changes to the Repository and Push those changes to Github

Follow the PR steps mentioned above

# This guide doesn't feel much technical. Please feel free to contribute to it

## How can I Contribute ?
This project aims to compile events, to be specific Hackathons, Open Source Events and Coding Competitions. Your responsibility is to search for such events and update them in the README.md file in chronological order

Format: | Date | Event Name | Organisation | Website | Details |

Example:
```
| 01 October 2022 | Hacktoberfest | DigitalOcean | hactoberfest.com | A month-long event that encourages developers to contribute to Open Source projects |

or 

| 20 October 2022 | Hackathon 6.0 | iNeuron | hack.ineuron.ai | 24hr Offline Hackathon at Bangalore |
```


## Where can I find these Events
That's an apt question. You can browse sites like [Devfolio](), [Devpost](), [LinkedIn]() and other Professional Networking sites

## Why this guide seems confusing ?
I too thought of the same. It might look slightly convincing for me but for beginners, It can be a liitle daunting. In such case, `Create an Issue` regarding that  and we'll make sure to patch it up quickly

## What's in it for me ?
- You'll get to know the flow of a Project through Git and Github
- You'll contribute to an Open Source project, which might qualify you for a T-shirt !!
- You'll discover some new things when you visit above mentioned sites looking for events
- What else do you want ? Stipend ?!
